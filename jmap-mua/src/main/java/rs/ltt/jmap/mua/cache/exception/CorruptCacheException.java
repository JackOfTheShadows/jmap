/**
 * A Cache implementation should throw this when it detects a problem it can not simply recover from.
 * For example seeing an update to an element it doesn't have stored or processing an addQueryResult when the
 * previous page is corrupt or out of sync.
 * MUA will then mark the cache for that object or for that query as invalid and overwrite it on the next request.
 *
 * This exception should not be thrown lightly as rebuilding the cache is potentially expensive.
